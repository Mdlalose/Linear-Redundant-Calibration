# Linear-Redundant-Calibration
lincal.py is a scipt which that got a function that compute best fits gains & true sky using  linear redundant calibration.

lincal_test_script.py is test scrpt, to run it , you to specify args as follows : xdim ydim noise_frac_gains noise_frac_sky n_iteration.
get_chi2_func.py contains chi squared, gradient & curvature functions.

newton_func.py this script contains function to for newton's method.

newton_cg_fits_test.py this is test scipt for newton's methods computing best fits gains & true sky
